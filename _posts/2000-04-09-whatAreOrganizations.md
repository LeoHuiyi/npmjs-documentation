npm Organizations allow you to manage and monitor access to both new and pre-existing public and private packages through the use of teams.

A great way to think about Organizations is that they are the umbrella structure that allows you to create teams and then grant package access to those teams.

These docs can be seen as being separated into 2 sections: people and packages.

<h3 id="managing-people"><a href="#managing-people">人员管理 <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/team">`npm team`</a></a></h3>

- [创建一个组织](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/setup)
- [Definition of Organizational Roles](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/roles)
- [团队和团队成员的权限](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/teams)

<h3 id="managing-package-access"><a href="#managing-package-access">管理包的使用权限 <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/access">`npm team`</a></a></h3>

An Organization can collaborate on 2 types of packages:

- [New packages scoped to the Organization
](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/scoping-packages)

- [Pre-existing public and private packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/preexisting-packages)

Additionally, all team members have the ability to [monitor access to packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/package-access).

<h3 id="cli-documentation"><a href="#cli-documentation">CLI 文档</a></h3>

For full documentation on the CLI commands associated with this feature:

- **`[npm team](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/team)`**
- **`[npm access](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/access)`**
