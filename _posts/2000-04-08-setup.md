组织和组织中的成员关系需要到 [npm 的网站](https://www.npmjs.com/org)去创建

<h3 id="creating-an-organization"><a href="#creating-an-organization">创建一个组织</a></h3>

In order to create an Organization, you must be logged in as a npm user with a verified email address. To create an npm user, [click here](https://www.npmjs.com/signup). There are 2 ways to create an organization:

- [New Scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/setup#create-an-organization-with-a-new-scope)
- [Pre-existing User Scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/setup#migrating-an-existing-username-to-an-org)

<h4 id="create-an-organization-with-a-new-scope"><a href="#create-an-organization-with-a-new-scope">Create an Organization with a new scope:</a></h4>

1. 前往 [http://www.npmjs.com/](http://www.npmjs.com/) 并登录
2. 访问 [https://www.npmjs.com/org/](https://www.npmjs.com/org/)
3. 点击名为“Create an Organization” 的红色按钮

Once you've created an Organization, you can perform a wide variety of tasks on your Organization Dashboard.

Your Organization Dashboard is located:

``` bash
https://www.npmjs.com/org/<org>
```

...<org> 代表你组织的名字

By default, your Organization is set up with a [developers team](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/developers-team). Whenever you add a new member to your Organization, they are automatically added to the developers team.

You may delete the developers team. If you do, newly added Organization members will not be added to any teams by default.

For more information about the developers team, 请看 [开发者团队](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/developers-team)

To add a member to your organization, you add them by their npm username via the [组织控制面板](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/setup#organization-dashboard).


<h3 id="creating-team-admins"><a href="#creating-team-admins">新建团队管理者</a></h3>

As the creator of the Organization you are granted the role of Super Admin.

For more information about the [Super Admin](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/roles#super-admin) and [Team Admin](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/roles#team-admin) roles, checkout the [Roles](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/roles) documentation.

<h3 id="migrating-an-existing-username-to-an-org"><a href="#migrating-an-existing-username-to-an-org">Migrating an existing username to an Org</a></h3>

Many users have already registered an npm user with the `@scope` they want to use for their org. If you attempt to register an org with a scope already in use, and you are already logged in as that user, you will be prompted to automatically migrate that user to an org.

Once your `@scope` is owned by an org, **you can no longer log in as your former username**. Orgs are not users and do not have usernames and passwords. During migration, you will be prompted to pick a new username. This new user will have the same password as your old user, but all packages that belonged to your old user will now belong to the org. Your new user will have Super-Admin privileges to the org.
